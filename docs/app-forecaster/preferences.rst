Log options
-----------

Log preferences are specific to each tool. They define the display of the log window and the level of reported log:

1. Only errors - recommended as long as everything goes as planned.
2. Errors and warnings - some warnings help to be vigilant in case of problems. However, there might be warnings even during normal operation.
3. All messages - all operations are reported, which is an unnecessary amount of information during normal operation. As a result, important messages are hidden in the standard operating flow, the program is slowed down and its memory usage increases. This option is useful for identifying the source of an error in case of problems.
